    "text": "The Oldham Lab in the Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Division and the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and Harvard Medical School studies how metabolic reprogramming in cells contributes to lung disease. We are particularly interested in the pathobiology of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, studying in vitro and in vivo model systems with state-of-the-art analytical techniques, including metabolomics, stable isotope tracing, extracellular flux analyses, systems biology, and network medicine. Our motivating hypothesis is that defining how cell metabolism changes in lung disease will identify new targets for drug development."

She joins the group from the University of Iceland where she continues her work in close collaboration with colleagues from the Center for Systems Biology. She will use her time here to study how the endothelial glycocalyx contributes to endothelial cell redox homeostasis and how various pathologic stressors affect this relationship."
