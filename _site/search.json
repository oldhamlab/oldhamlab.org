    "text": "The Oldham Lab in the Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Division and the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School studies how cellular metabolic reprogramming in contributes to lung diseases. We are particularly interested in the pathobiology of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, studying in vitro and in vivo model systems with state-of-the-art analytical techniques, including metabolomics, stable isotope tracing, extracellular flux analyses, systems biology, and network medicine. Our motivating hypothesis is that defining how cell metabolism changes in lung disease will identify opportunities for therapeutic development."
