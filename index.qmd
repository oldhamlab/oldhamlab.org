The Oldham Lab in the [Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Division](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/medicine/pulmonary-and-critical-care-medicine) 
and the [Department of Medicine](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/department-of-medicine) at 
[Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/) and 
[Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) studies how cellular metabolic reprogramming 
in contributes to lung diseases. We are particularly interested in the pathobiology 
of pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis, studying *in vitro* and *in vivo* 
model systems with state-of-the-art analytical techniques, including metabolomics, 
stable isotope tracing, extracellular flux analyses, systems biology, and network 
medicine. **Our motivating hypothesis is that defining how cell metabolism 
changes in lung disease will identify opportunities for therapeutic development.**
